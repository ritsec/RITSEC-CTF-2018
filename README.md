### CTF
- CTFd Plugins
    - Resume collection at signin
    - Finding the user that solved a challenge (Only shows team by default)
        - Should be an administrative view
    - Programming Challenges
        - Premium CTFd has this built in
        - Potentially have CI checks that runs the code and then if the checks are passed, the code is reviewed by an admin
        - C, Python, bash
