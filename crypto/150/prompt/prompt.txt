See the attached PDF for an amazing new Cryptographic Hash Function
called CictroHash. For this challenge you must implement the
described Hash Function and then find a collision of two strings.
Once a collision is found send both strings to {{INSERT_SERVER}}
as a HTTP POST request like below:

curl -X POST http://{{INSERT_SERVER}}/checkCollision \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"str1": "{{INSERT_STR1}}", "str2": "{{INSERT_STR2}}"}'

If the strings are a valid collision then the flag will be returned.
